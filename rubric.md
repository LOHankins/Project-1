## Project Workflow
Performing - Couldn't really view the wireframe, not sure what kind of file extension odp is, but i'm sure it was great! User stories look good. It would be really nice if there were setup instructions so that people could contribute to your application or give them a general overview of your app.

## Technical Requirement
Performing - There's a lot of code here. There's a clear understanding of the fundamentals from this project. However, I would say there are lots of opportunities to clean up this codebase. By my count there are 26 variable declarations at the very top of the application. This is not neccessarily bad; however, it can start to really cloud up your developement when you're trying to wonder about where there all coming from. I would recommend organizing some of this logic into a more object oriented approach. Where some of these variables are properties of objects instead. In that way we can create methods within objects that leverage these variables.

## Code Quality
Performing - Code is properly formatted/indented. Coming back to this code after 2-3 weeks will be difficult. It has no comments! There are lots of function definitions and invocations happening in various places, its hard to discern it all. I would recommend group parts of your code that are relevant to each other. Start figuring out ways to leverage the data rather than hardcoding logic into the DOM itself.

## Creativity/Interface
Performing/Progressing - Really like the idea. I encourage you to keep working on the timer to eliminate responses as the time goes. But more importantly, make sure the core functionality is bug free. 

Great job overall Louis!
